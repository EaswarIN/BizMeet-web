		 <h1 style="display:inline-block;">BizMeet Privacy Policy <h5 style="display:inline-block;">v3 August 26th, 2015</h5></h1>
		 <p>BizMeet ("HubLink Networks AG, hereafter HLN") takes your privacy seriously. We are as such committed to give you transparency of our privacy practices and control over your data in connection with BizMeet Services. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy ("Policy"). This Policy details how we receive, collect and use information in connection with our BizMeet software ("BizMeet App"), the BizMeet-hub.com website ("Site") and other products and services ("Service") provided through the BizMeet app or HLN.</p>
		 <p>By using BizMeet, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Policy, as such the Policy may be amended from time to time. Each time you use BizMeet, you agree and expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this Policy.</p>
		<p>This Privacy Policy covers HLN treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") and other data that HubLink Networks gathers when you are accessing BizMeet's Services.</p>
		<h2>1. Collection and Use of Information</h2>
		<h2>BizMeet App</h2>
		<p>When you install and register the BizMeet app, you will be asked to provide us with your phone number, name, email address, password and a photo (name and photo are not mandatory) and to allow us access to your mobile device's address book.
		</p>
		<p>Only a copy of the phone numbers of your address book (but not names, emails, notes or any other Personal Information from your contacts in your address book) will be stored on our servers and will only be used to:</p>
		<p class="point">(a) Indicate which of your contacts are already BizMeet users and mutually connected with you.</p>
		<p class="point">(b) Which are BizMeet users, but not mutually connected and which are not on BizMeet.</p>
		<p class="point">(c) Indicate which of your contacts are nearby.</p>
		<p class="point">(d) Sync your contacts with the BizMeet server to maintain accurate and up to date information in alignment with our user safety policy.</p>
		<p>The copy of your contacts phone numbers is stored on a live database. If you request to deactivate your account (more about this below under Section 7), it will be deleted instantly and permanently.</p>
		<p>Your phone number is used for identification purposes as your BizMeet user ID and is stored in our database, and will be considered private information by HLN and therefore not distributed or shared with third parties for any reason. However, since other BizMeet users may add your BizMeet number to their address book to follow you or see if you are registered with BizMeet, we do not consider the fact that your BizMeet number exists on BizMeet for the purpose of connecting with other BizMeet users as private information.</p>
		<p>BizMeet may interact with your phone's native messaging app for the sole purpose of;</p>
		<p class="point">(a) Provide registration verification number for activating the BizMeet service and</p>
		<p class="point">(b) enabling you the ability to invite potential users to BizMeet through SMS.</p>
		<p>WE WILL NOT ACCESS THE CONTENTS OF ANY OTHER SMS MESSAGES. We use the services of third parties to process your registration verification number and we require that these third parties take the appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to comply with relevant laws.</p>
		<p>With location services being at the core of the BizMeet App we automatically receive your location when you use the Services. We use various technologies to determine location, such as location services of the applicable operating system or browser and sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi or Beacon access points and cell towers.</p>
		<h2>Name and Photo</h2>
		<p>Should you provide your name and/or photo it will be visible to other BizMeet users as long as such users have your BizMeet number.</p>
		<h2>Online, Messaging and Meeting Status</h2>
		<p>To ensure our user privacy standards are met, there are no specific indicators displayed as to whether a user is online or not, at any given time. Other users that are able to see and follow you as a result of your connection status and privacy settings (Hide/Unhide) may be able to determine your status by observing your movement across the map.</p>
		<p>At this time BizMeet does not provide "Delivered" or "Seen" status indications for chat messages sent between users.  Meeting status is only indicated with "Sent" or "Accepted" status, declined or canceled meeting statuses are not displayed.</p>
		<h2>Location Information</h2>
		<p>BizMeet allows you to share your location with other users with whom you are connected through your address book. If you choose to share your location with a specific user or group of users your location will be retrieved from your device and sent to BizMeet. BizMeet will then in turn only send the location information to the devices of users that are following you, and from which you have not hidden yourself. BizMeet only relays the location data among consenting users and will not share or store your location information and do not use it for any purpose except for the inherent purpose of the app as specifically utilized by you.
		</p>
		<h2>BizMeet Invite</h2>
		<p>If you wish to use BizMeet to invite contacts in your address book outside of the BizMeet community ("BizMeet Invite"), you will be sending an SMS through your native messaging app on your device. BizMeet and its parent HLN does not charge you the user for any such messaging, however, please be advised that based on your mobile contract with your carrier, your carrier may charge you for such SMS.</p>
		<h2>Cookies, Clear GIFs and Other Automatically Collected Data</h2>
		<p>If you have permitted your computer to accept cookies, we may use cookies on the Site. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier by saving preferences and browsing patterns while you are at the Site. Cookies may be used to analyze the Site usage, improve content, customize the Site's content and layout and for other customer service purposes. A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Site to other information about you, including your Personal Information. All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Site. Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Site or certain areas or features of the Site.
		</p>
		<p>We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies, in the Site and/or in our communications with you to enable us to evaluate Site usage information about visitors to the Site, target campaigns, upgrade visitor information, and know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or message. A clear gif may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Web page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.
		</p>
		<p>Our servers may automatically collect data about your Internet address when you visit the Site. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you are on the Internet. When you request pages from our Site, our servers may log your IP Address and, if applicable, your domain name. Your IP Address is used to help identify you and to gather demographic information about our members and users as a whole, but does not include personally identifiable information. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Site; the web site you visit after this Site; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Site or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our Service. Such information may also be used to gather demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.
		</p>
		<p>We will not link any Personal Information, including email addresses, with aggregate data of our users.</p>
		<p>Any or all of these activities with regard to Site usage information may be performed on our behalf by our service providers, including, for example, our development partner(s), our analytics vendor(s) and our SMS/email management partner(s).
		</p>
		<h2>Third-Party Sites and Privacy Practices</h2>
		<p>You may arrive at our Site and/or download the BizMeet App from another website. In addition, our Site may contain links that will let you leave our Site and access another website. Websites linked to or from our Site are not under the control of HLN and it is possible that these websites have a different privacy policy. Our Policy applies solely to Personal Information that is acquired on the Site or through your use of our Service, and/or your relationship with the BizMeet App. We urge you to be careful when you enter any Personal Information online. We accept no responsibility or liability for these other websites.</p>
		<h2>Analytics Collection</h2>
		<p>BizMeet may use Google Analytics to help us anonymously track and report user/visitor behavior information and users' standard log information to the Site and the BizMeet App. This information (including but not limited to: IP address, data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and information processing) helps us analyze and evaluate how the BizMeet App and Site are used as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the Site and the BizMeet App's features and services. No personally identifying data is included in this type of reporting. Google Analytics may have access to your information only for the purposes of performing these tasks and on behalf of HLN and under obligation similar in those in this Privacy Policy. For more information about the terms that govern Google Analytics, please visit the Google Analytics terms of service.</p>
		<p>We will never (and will not allow any third party to) use the statistical analytics tool to track or to collect any Personal Information of visitors or users. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. Neither we nor Google will link, or seek to link, an IP address with the identity of a device user. We will not associate any data gathered from this site with any Personally Identifiable Information from any source. 
		</p>
		<h2>2. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>
		<p>We do not rent, sell, or share any information about our users with any third-parties, except as specifically described herein. We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe such action is necessary to:
		</p>
		<p class="point">	(a) comply with the law, or legal process served on us;</p>
		<p class="point">	(b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); or</p>
		<p class="point">	(c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of our Service or members of the public.</p>
		<p>In order to provide you with the HLN products you have requested, HLN may sometimes, if necessary, share your Personal Information (excluding your address book and related information) and traffic data with trusted partner service providers and/or agents, for example: customer support, or hosting services. HLN will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation. HLN will never share your address book information with any third party, except as may be required by law (see below).
		</p>
		<p>The following is a description of how we may share your Personal Information with trusted third party partners. Should we add additional partners, we will immediately update this description:</p>
		<p class="point">1. We use third party companies in order to send you a verification SMS when you register with BizMeet. In order to send you the SMS, we send one of these third party companies your phone number and the verification message. These third parties are contractually obligated to only use your phone number for the transmission of the authentication SMS.</p>
		<p class="point">2. We use Push Notification Services to notify you about various events related to the app. When we do, the name of the person sending you a message, a meeting invite or enter into your contact radius is part of the notification. This message is sent to the push notification service provider, for delivery to your device.</p>
		<p>Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, HLN's BizMeet servers that are used to store your Personal Information are owned and hosted by parse.com, a Facebook owned PaaS platform. You can read more about measures taken by parse.com to protect the security of their servers and your Personal Information here:</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.parse.com/about/policies">https://www.parse.com/about/policies</a> </p>
		<p>We may disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance that disclosure of information is necessary.</p>
		<p>We may from time to time ask you to provide information about your experiences, which will be used to measure and improve quality. You are at no time under any obligation to provide any of such data. Any and all information which is voluntarily submitted in feedback forms on the Site or from the BizMeet App or any survey that you accept to take part in is used for the purposes of reviewing this feedback and improving the BizMeet software, products and websites.
		</p>
		<p>We may contact you to send you messages about faults and service issues. Furthermore, we reserve the right to use email, the BizMeet software or SMS to notify you of any eventual claims related to your use of our software, websites and/or products, including without limitation claims of violation of third party rights.</p>
		<p>We may send you alerts via the BizMeet software to notify you when someone has tried to contact you. We may also use the BizMeet software to keep you up to date with news about our software and products that you have purchased and/or to inform you about other HLN products and related information.
		</p>
		<h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>
		<p>BizMeet websites and software clients are not intended for or designed to attract anyone under the age of 13 and we do not intentionally or knowingly collect Personal Information on our sites from anyone under the age of 13 (or older in some jurisdictions). We encourage parents to be involved in the online activities of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental permission.
		</p>
		<h2>4. Security</h2>
		<p>We take reasonable precaution to protect Personal Information from misuse, loss and unauthorized access. Although we cannot guarantee that Personal Information will not be subject to unauthorized access, we have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in place to protect Personal Information. Personal Information is stored on our servers and protected by secured networks to which access is limited to a few authorized employees and personnel. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
		</p>
		<p>Your BizMeet account Personal Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately, and limiting access to the BizMeet App by others. The Services may contain links to other sites. BizMeet is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site, you should read the privacy policy stated on that site. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services.
		</p>
		<p>HLN is a Swiss company that strictly adheres to the Privacy Act of the Swiss Confederation (Federal Act on Data Protection, 235.1 from June 19, 1992, edition 1. January 2014). Our main servers are located in Germany and are as such also subject to EU Data Protection laws. Since the BizMeet App is an international product and partly hosted by Parse.com it may from time to time utilize servers located outside of Switzerland and the EU. Therefore portions of your information may be processed and stored in the country where you are currently utilizing the BizMeet App or outside of your home country and be subject to the local laws governing the collection, use, and retention of personal information. As a result, based on those countries legal structure federal and state governments, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through laws applicable in those countries. Your use of the Site or the Services or your submission of any Personal Information to us will constitute your consent to the transfer of your Personal Information outside of your home country, which may provide for different data protection rules than in your country.
		</p>
		<h2>5. Business Transitions</h2>
		<p>In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. As part of such a transaction the new entity will be required to commit to the same level of protection of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we cannot obtain such a commitment, we will not perform the business transition.
		</p>
		<p>We will post a notice on this Site of any such change in ownership or control of the Personal Information we may have prior to such transfer.</p>
		<h2>6. Changes to Policy</h2>
		<p>From time to time, we may revise this Policy. We reserve the right to update or modify this Policy, or any other of our policies or practices, at any time with or without notice. However, we will not use your Personal Information in a way that is materially different than the uses described in this Policy without giving you an opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses. We will post the revised Policy on the Site, so that users can always be aware of what information we collect, how the information is used and under what circumstances such information may be disclosed. You agree to review the Policy periodically so that you are aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the BizMeet App and/or Site indicates your assent to any changes and signifies your agreement to the terms of our Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the Site, the BizMeet App, or any other Service as provided by HLN.</p>
		<h2>7. Change or Removal of Information</h2>
		<p>If you provided your email address to us and wish to update it, you may do so by sending an email to <a href="#"class="blue">support@bizmeet-hub.com</a>.
		</p>
		<p>If you no longer wish to receive e-mail or message communication from us, such as offers, update information and newsletters, you may opt-out of receiving such communications by going to OPT-OUT under settings in the BizMeet app and change the slider setting from off to on.
		</p>
		<p>Due to technological reasons, we do not know when and if you delete the application. Therefore, if we detect no activity from your device for 4 hours we will dim your location indicator on the map and completely remove it after 24 hours. Furthermore, if there has been no activity for 90 days, we will assume that you deleted the application. However, since we are not certain that you deleted the application (you may just be on an extended vacation, etc.) we will not deactivate your BizMeet account (which is your phone number and device ID). We do not want to force you to register again in the event of non-use.</p>
		<p>If you wish to delete your account completely, you can do so at any time by going to DEACTIVATE ACCOUNT under settings and enter the information needed to deactivate your account. Please note that this will remove your data from BizMeet, and deactivate BizMeet on your device. Because of the way we maintain BizMeet, such deletion may not be immediate, and residual copies of your profile information may remain on backup media for up to ninety (90) days. If you have additional concerns and/or requests, you can contact BizMeet at <a class="blue" href="#">support@bizmeet-hub.com</a>.
